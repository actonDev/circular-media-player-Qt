# Circular Media Player

This is a project I started back in the summer of 2012. Was seeing some tutorials in youtube for Qt C++ development (and drawing), and next thing I know I was stuck above a keyboard developing this. I had some blog posts regarding the development at http://actondev.wordpress.com/

Later I did a web version of this, first in  php using `laravel` and then switched to `Single Page Application` with `angular`. That last version is available at http://cmp.actondev.com/

Developed with Qt Creator, using Qt under LGPL, TagLib under LGPL.
No guarantee for anything or whatever.
